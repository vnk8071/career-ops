/**
 * updater-channel-resolution.test.mjs — apply() must fetch a reproducible
 * release, not whatever main happens to be at the moment it runs.
 *
 * The regression: apply()'s only fetch call was hardcoded to CANONICAL_REPO's
 * `main`. release-please can bump VERSION on main hours before the matching
 * tag lands (and, rarely, before a fix for a bug introduced in that window
 * lands too), so a same-moment `main` fetch can install an untagged
 * intermediate commit — reproducing a real support case where a user's
 * VERSION file said v1.30.0 but their code was not the v1.30.0 release.
 *
 * resolveTargetRef() is the fix: the default ('release') channel resolves to
 * the newest published release tag via RELEASES_API; `--channel main` (flag
 * or, for the re-exec'd child, CAREER_OPS_UPDATE_CHANNEL=main) opts back into
 * tracking main, with no network call at all. A failed release lookup on the
 * default channel throws — silently falling back to main would reintroduce
 * the exact bug this closes, on exactly the network blip that makes it matter.
 *
 * One more failure mode this pins: this is a manifest-mode monorepo that also
 * releases a sibling `web` component (`web-vX.Y.Z`), and RELEASES_API's
 * `/releases/latest` returns correctly ONLY because release.yml's "Keep the
 * career-ops release marked as Latest" step re-asserts it on every push. If
 * that step ever silently stopped doing its job, `/releases/latest` would
 * hand back a `web-*` tag and, without a guard, apply() would fetch and
 * install it without complaint. resolveTargetRef() rejects any tag not
 * prefixed `career-ops-v` for exactly this reason.
 *
 * These tests drive the real export against an injected ctx.curlGet, the
 * same seam production uses (ctx.git elsewhere in this suite) — no real
 * network, no git fixture needed, since resolveTargetRef never touches git.
