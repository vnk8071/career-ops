// tests/apply-mode-tailored-cv.test.mjs — the apply mode's two load-bearing
// contracts: which document supplies an experience field, and what has to be
// true before the action that commits a step.
//
// Both failures these cover are silent. A form filled from cv.md contradicts the
// resume stapled to it, and nothing errors. A required control left unset is
// reported by the ATS as a validation error the run has already called filled.
//
// Prose is asserted with whitespace normalized, because modes/apply.md is
// hard-wrapped: a probe that reads correctly in the file can straddle a line
// break and never match. A prose anchor that silently stops matching is the
// worst shape for a check like this, since it passes forever afterwards.
