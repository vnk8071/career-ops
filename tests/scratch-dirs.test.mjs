 * scratch-dirs.test.mjs — a killed test run must not turn the next one red.
 *
 * `test-all.mjs` copies the checkout into a `.tmp-script-test-*` directory and
 * removes it in a `finally` that an interrupted run never reaches. The leftover
 * is gitignored and carries no `.git`, so neither `git status` nor
 * `isNestedCheckout()` sees it, and every walker reads a second copy of the
 * repository as source: 264 failures on a clean `main`, all naming correct
 * files, none reproducible for anybody else (#3940).
 *
 * The assertions below run the real walk and the real sweep against real
 * directories rather than checking that the prefix appears somewhere. What
 * broke here was never the spelling of a string; it was that a directory
 * nothing could see was being graded as source.
