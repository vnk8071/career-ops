/**
 * updater-remote-manifest-user-paths.test.mjs — BEHAVIORAL coverage for the
 * guard on the FETCHED manifest.
 *
 * apply() reads SYSTEM_PATHS out of the updater it just fetched and merges it
 * into updatePaths, the list the per-path `git checkout FETCH_HEAD -- <path>`
 * walks. An entry naming user territory therefore writes upstream's content over
 * the user's own, and an UNTRACKED local file is invisible to the diff-based
 * #2337 detector — so it gets no .bak, is not preserved, and is then deleted by
 * the abort path as an addition HEAD lacks, while the run prints "your content
 * was NOT overwritten". Refusing the entry is what stops that sequence starting.
 *
 * rejectUserLayerPaths() is pure and exported for the same reason
 * userLayerViolations() is: apply() is ROOT-bound and full of side effects, so
 * the rule is pinned directly rather than inferred from an end-to-end run.
 *
 * The `writing-samples/README.md` case below is the important one. The obvious
 * implementation reuses the matcher already inlined in userLayerViolations()
 * and filters every remote path that touches the user layer — which silently
 * drops the four system-owned docs that legitimately ship inside user
 * directories today. That failure raises no error and produces no output; it
 * looks exactly like upstream not having changed those files, which is #958.
