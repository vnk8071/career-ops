// tests/scan-filtered-offers-recorded.test.mjs — what `location_filter` and
// `max_posting_age_days` remove has to leave a trace in scan-history.tsv.
//
// Eleven filters can reject a job inside the scan loop, and exactly one of them
// - the cooldown - wrote a scan-history row; everything the verify and guard
// stages reject is recorded too (`skipped_expired`,
// `skipped_no_apply_control`, `skipped_invalid_url`, `skipped_blocked_host`).
// These two wrote nothing, so the only evidence they ran was a counter printed
// once and never stored. A filter that is slightly too tight is then
// indistinguishable from a portal that had nothing to offer, in the run's own
// output and in every later analysis over the history file.
//
// The rows are deliberately WEIGHTLESS for dedup, which is the half that is
// easy to get wrong. Every other skipped status describes the posting - a dead
// URL stays dead - so pinning it spares a later scan the work. These two
// describe the user's config, and `location_filter` / `max_posting_age_days`
// are thresholds they edit: a row written under the old threshold must not
// suppress the same posting under the new one. Recording a drop in order to
// make it permanent would be worse than not recording it.
