// tests/outcome-archive-local-dates.test.mjs — the outcome and archival path
// dates records by the user's calendar, not by UTC's.
//
// lib/local-today.mjs exists because "what day is it" has a wrong answer:
// `new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10)` is the UTC day, so west of Greenwich
// an evening run answers with TOMORROW. #2765 fixed followup-seed, #2932
// set-status, #3070 the gates, and outcome.mjs's today() has since been
// converted too. archive-posting.mjs and application-answers.mjs were in none of
// those sweeps and still read the UTC day; this file fixes those two.
//
// outcome.mjs is covered here as a GUARD rather than a fix. It is the script that
// shows why the rule matters: it writes its journal with today() and, in the same
// invocation, spawns set-status.mjs, which stamps data/status-log.tsv with
// localToday(). If today() ever went back to UTC, one event would again produce
// two records a day apart -- so the agreement between those two files is worth an
// assertion even though both sides are correct today.
//
// ── How these assertions avoid the trap that hid the bug ────────────────────
//
// The window where the UTC day and the local day disagree covers only part of
// the UTC day, so a test that reads the wall clock passes for most of the day
// whether the fix is present or not. tests/local-today-gates.test.mjs solves
// that by pinning a frozen instant into a `node -e` child, which works when the
// thing under test is an EXPORT. Two of these three are only reachable through
// their CLI, and freezing a CLI's clock needs either a --import preload (Node
// 18.19+, above this project's `>=18`) or an argv[1]-rewriting launcher, which
// tests/main-guard-convention.test.mjs gates behind a named exemption.
//
// So: run the same command in TWO timezones 25 hours apart. Pacific/Kiritimati
// is UTC+14 and Pacific/Midway is UTC-11, and two local times 25 hours apart
// cannot share a calendar date -- at any instant, on any day of the year. A
// UTC-derived date is identical in both runs; a local one cannot be. The
// assertion therefore discriminates at every hour of the day, with no frozen
// clock and no wall-clock literal to go stale.
