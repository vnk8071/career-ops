// tests/plugins-data-root.test.mjs — Bugs 2 & 3 regression:
//   Bug 2: plugins.mjs must derive APPLICATIONS_PATH and PIPELINE_PATH from
//     the data root (CAREER_OPS_ROOT), not from the code directory.
//   Bug 3: buildSnapshot() must parse pipeline.md checklist entries, not a table.
//
// Imports the REAL plugins.mjs with CAREER_OPS_ROOT set before the dynamic
// import so the module-level constants are evaluated against the temp root.
// Uses _testPaths and _testBuildSnapshot — the minimal named exports added to
// plugins.mjs to make its internal constants and snapshot function inspectable
// without duplicating path-resolution logic in the test.
