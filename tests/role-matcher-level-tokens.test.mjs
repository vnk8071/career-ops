// tests/role-matcher-level-tokens.test.mjs — a level stated on both sides of
// a title comparison must agree.
//
// `roleTokens` drops every word of three characters or fewer, which is right
// for prepositions and wrong for exactly one kind of word: a level. Every
// roman numeral up to VIII and every single digit falls under the filter, so
// "Insurance Specialist I" and "Insurance Specialist II" tokenized identically
// and scored a perfect Jaccard ratio. merge-tracker then folded the second
// requisition into the first, kept the first's title, and the second stopped
// existing — invisible to dedup, to the tracker, and to anything that reads it.
//
// Measured on a real 316-posting corpus: 15 titles carried a level, and none
// of those postings stated a requisition number that the Notes-column guard
// (#1524) could have caught instead. The title is the only signal.
//
// The rule mirrors the seniority rule that already exists: stated on BOTH
// sides, the levels must overlap; stated on one side alone, it is a loose
// rewrite of one opening ("Engineer" vs "Senior Engineer"), not evidence of
// two. Roman and arabic forms fold onto one number. Nothing about the
// tokenizer changes, so every existing behaviour is asserted unchanged below.
