/**
 * web-ts-alias-loader.test.mjs — the resolver hook that teaches `node --test` to
 * follow the `@/…` import alias.
 *
 * web/tsconfig.json maps `"@/*" -> "./src/*"`, which webpack and SWC understand
 * natively and Node does not. Node 22 type-strips `.ts` on import, so the only
 * thing standing between `node --test` and a TS module under web/src is
 * SPECIFIER RESOLUTION — and without it the import fails as
 * `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package '@/lib'`, which reads in CI exactly
 * like a test that ran and passed nothing.
 *
 * Every assertion here runs in a CHILD process. The hook installs itself
 * globally and cannot be uninstalled, so an in-process "without the loader"
 * control would be contaminated by any earlier test that registered it — the
 * control would pass for the wrong reason and prove nothing.

// web/package.json allows Node >=22 (the floor `node --test` glob discovery

// default only from 22.18. On 22.0-22.17 the child dies with
// ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION before resolve() is ever consulted, so those four
// would fail for a reason that has nothing to do with the hook they test.
//
// Skip rather than raise the floor: web/'s engines governs the Next.js app, not
// just this suite, and apply-planner-fencing.test.mjs and
// apply-agent-interpret-fencing.test.mjs already take exactly this stance for
