// Cumulative "how far has this search actually got?" counters for the analytics
// headline tiles. Pure JS (no TS types) so it can be imported by the analytics
// page and unit-tested under `node --test`, matching clean-chips.mjs /
// stream-parse.mjs / act-envelope.mjs.
//
// The "Pipeline by stage" BARS below the tiles are deliberately a current-state
// snapshot — Hired, Rejected and Discarded are each their own bar, and an
// application sits in exactly one. The two headline tiles are a different
// question: they are achievement counters ("interviews", "offers") whose
// zero-state shows a coaching nudge. Reading a snapshot count there means a
// candidate who ADVANCED past a stage reads zero for it and gets told to try
// harder to reach the stage they already cleared.
//
// The cumulative math is the core's, not a new invention: computeFunnel() in
// stats.mjs is the canonical definition —
//   everInterview = Interview + Offer + Hired
//   everOffer     = Offer + Hired
// — on the reasoning that a landed job proves the offer and everything before
// it. A rejection proves a response, but not an interview or offer. The
// ledger-aware variant below recovers those stages from actual transitions.
