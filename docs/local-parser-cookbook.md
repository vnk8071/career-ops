# Local Parser Cookbook

Local parsers let `scan.mjs` read SSR, static, or user-saved career pages without asking an agent to browse the page. The parser runs as a local command, prints normalized jobs JSON to stdout, and lets the scanner keep using the same title filtering, deduplication, and pipeline output flow.

## When To Use This

Use `scan_method: local_parser` when a company career page has stable HTML, a documented endpoint, or another deterministic source that is easier to parse locally than with Playwright. The parser can be written in JavaScript, Python, shell, Go, or any executable available on the user's machine. Company-specific parsers are user-supplied and referenced from `portals.yml`; copy them into the gitignored `local/` directory so site-specific HTML can evolve independently from core.

## Portal Configuration

Most local parsers are company-specific: the script already knows the source URL, selectors, endpoint quirks, pagination, and normalization rules. In that common case, the scanner only needs to know which command to run:

```yaml
- name: Example Company
  careers_url: https://example.com/careers
  scan_method: local_parser
  parser:
    command: node
    script: local/example-company-jobs.js
    format: jobs-json-v1
  enabled: true
```

`args` are optional. Use them in whatever way helps the parser author: to make one script reusable across multiple companies, pass `{careers_url}` or `{company}`, enable a debug flag, store a JSON snapshot, or control any other script-specific behavior. `scan.mjs` executes the parser without shell interpolation and expands `{careers_url}` and `{company}` in parser arguments before execution.

## Where the script lives

`providers/local-parser.mjs` only runs a script that resolves **inside the repository root** — a whitelisted interpreter (`node`, `python3`, …) must take an in-repo script as its first argument, and a path that escapes the root is rejected. This is a deliberate boundary: `portals.yml` is not fully trusted on a shared or template config, so the parser command cannot point at an arbitrary binary or a file outside the checkout.

Because the script has to sit in the tree, put a parser you do not intend to contribute under a path that Git ignores, so it is never staged:

- `local/` is gitignored by default. `local/acme-jobs.mjs` is the simplest home for a one-off, company-specific parser.
- `portals.yml` is already a user-layer file (gitignored), so the `parser:` block that points at the script stays private too.

Use `scripts/parsers/` only for a parser you plan to open a PR for. `career-ops` does not bundle company-specific parser scripts, so in practice that is rare.

## Token savings

`scan.mjs` uses **0 LLM tokens** for discovery: parsers run locally and only normalized job rows enter the pipeline.

In agent scan mode (`/career-ops scan`), Playwright and API niveles send large page or JSON payloads into the model. When Nivel 0 succeeds, `modes/scan.md` requires skipping those niveles for the same company (`local_parser_ok`).

Measured benchmarks (Cohere + Mobileye fixtures, `tiktoken` `cl100k_base`, Playwright vs parser vs API) live on branch `feature/local-parser-integration-tests` with `npm run test:scan-tokens` and full tables in that branch's copy of this cookbook.

## Stdout Contract

The parser must print one of these JSON shapes to stdout:

```json
[
  { "title": "Senior AI Engineer", "url": "https://example.com/jobs/123", "location": "Remote" }
]
```

```json
{
  "jobs": [
    { "title": "Senior AI Engineer", "url": "https://example.com/jobs/123", "location": "Remote" }
  ]
}
```

```json
{
  "results": [
    { "title": "Senior AI Engineer", "url": "https://example.com/jobs/123", "location": "Remote" }
  ]
}
```

`title` and `url` are required. `company` is optional; when omitted, the scanner uses the `tracked_companies` entry name. `location` is optional. `postedAt` is optional — an epoch-milliseconds number or a `Date.parse`-able string (`"2026-09-08"`, an ISO timestamp); `posted_at` / `publishedAt` / `published_at` / `published_date` / `datePosted` / `date_posted` are accepted as aliases (the last is what a page's JSON-LD `JobPosting` block calls it). It feeds `--posted-after` / `--since` and the scan output's posting-date column; an unparseable value is dropped and the row is still kept. Relative URLs are resolved against `careers_url`.

## Artifact Storage

The scanner only needs stdout. If a parser also writes full JSON snapshots for debugging or audit, store them under `data/parser-output/{company}/`. Generated JSON artifacts must stay out of git; `.gitkeep` placeholders are the only committed exception for preserving directory structure.

## Recipes

Optional site-specific examples live under [`docs/recipes/`](recipes/). These
recipes are documentation examples, not bundled core integrations; copy the
parser you want into `local/`, review it, and point your private `portals.yml`
entry at that local copy. The
[Ontario GO Jobs recipe](recipes/gojobs/) demonstrates a deliberately offline
workflow for HTML saved after a normal browser session; it never automates or
bypasses the site's interactive challenge.

## Failure Handling

Local parsers run before ATS API detection. If a local parser fails and the company has a detectable Greenhouse, Ashby, or Lever API source, `scan.mjs` records the parser failure and falls back to the API path for that company instead of dropping it from the scan.

## Agent scan (`/career-ops scan`)

`scan.mjs` already uses one provider per company (local parser only, no duplicate API pass). In full agent scan mode (`modes/scan.md`), when Nivel 0 succeeds for a company, the agent must **skip** Playwright (Nivel 1) and API (Nivel 2) for that company, and filter Nivel 3 WebSearch hits that match the same company. General portal queries (`site:jobs.ashbyhq.com`, role keywords) still run for discovery of other employers.
