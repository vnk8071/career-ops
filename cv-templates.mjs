// A pack is a subdirectory holding its own `<prefix>.<name>.<format>` next to
// its own `sections/`. That co-location is the whole point: build-cv-html.mjs
// resolves partials relative to the template file, so a pack gets its own DOM
// without touching the `sections/` every flat template shares.
//
// The template name comes from the *filename*, exactly as it does for a flat
// template — never from the directory name. `templates/ats/cv-template.ats.html`
// is template "ats" because of the file, and the directory could be called
// anything. That keeps one naming rule instead of two.
//
// Packs are one level deep only. Nothing here recurses: a pack's `sections/`
// must not be mistaken for a nested pack, and an arbitrarily deep walk over a
// user-writable directory is a cost (and a surface) with no use case behind it.
//
// Symlinked directories are followed, which needs an explicit stat because
// `Dirent.isDirectory()` is false for a symlink.
//
// Refusing them looks like the safer default and isn't. A symlink grants no
// capability its creator lacked: anyone who can drop `templates/mine` as a link
// can drop it as a real directory holding the same file, so skipping buys no
// protection against a hostile template — it only makes a legitimate one
// vanish. The repo's actual symlink guards are on a different axis, and both
// stay intact: resolveInsideRepo() in reconcile-pipeline.mjs resolves
// user-supplied path *arguments* before a boundary check, and contacts.mjs
// refuses to *write* through a link escaping the project. Discovery does
// neither — it enumerates a directory the project owns and only ever reads.
//
// Cycles are not a concern precisely because this walk is one level and never
// recurses; a link pointing at its own ancestor is read once as a directory
// and contributes whatever template files sit at its top level.
//
// The deciding cost is silent invisibility. career-ops sanctions a symlinked
// user layer (#524), so a pack maintained outside the repo is a supported
// setup, and skipping it would drop the template from the registry with
// nothing said — the same failure this file refuses to accept for name
