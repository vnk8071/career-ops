/**
 * scratch-dirs.mjs — the one definition of "a throwaway copy of this checkout".
 *
 * Section 75 of `test-all.mjs` copies the whole checkout into
 * `mkdtempSync(join(ROOT, '.tmp-script-test-'))` so the script smoke tests can
 * run against a tree they are free to damage, and removes it in a `finally`. A
 * run killed between the two — a timeout, Ctrl-C, a crash — never reaches that
 * `finally` and leaves the copy behind.
 *
 * Nothing then notices. `.gitignore` carries a directory rule for the prefix, so
 * `git status` is empty; the copy excludes `.git`, so `isNestedCheckout()` in
 * `mjs-files.mjs` cannot recognise it either. Every walker reads the stale copy
 * as part of the repository, and the guards that grade file LAYOUT are the ones
 * that break: a full second copy of `tests/` is, to
 * `tests/core-test-layout.test.mjs`, several hundred suites sitting outside
 * `tests/`. Measured on a clean `main`: 264 failures locally against 0 in CI,
 * naming paths under `.tmp-script-test-OP9Bzd/.tmp-script-test-tBjFgy/…`
 * (#3940). The nesting in that path is the second half of the bug — the copy
 * loop did not exclude an existing scratch either, so each run wrapped the
 * previous leftover inside its own.
 *
 * That failure shape is worse than a plain false red. It is unreproducible for
 * anyone else, it points at correct files, it appears on a commit the developer
 * did not write, and the state causing it is invisible to every command they
 * would think to run.
 *
 * The prefix lives here rather than at its three use sites because it was
 * already written twice — the `mkdtempSync` call and `.gitignore` — and had
 * begun to drift: one of them knew the scratch directory existed and the other
 * did not. A consumer that must recognise a scratch directory imports
 * `isScratchDir`; it cannot be spelled slightly differently in a fourth place.
 *
 * `.gitignore` is the one copy that cannot import this, since git reads it. Its
 * rule is the prefix followed by a glob and a directory slash, and
 * `tests/scratch-dirs.test.mjs` pins the two against each other by asking git
 * itself whether it ignores a directory named from this constant — a textual
 * comparison would pass on a rule that no longer matches anything.

/**
 * Remove every scratch directory directly under `root` that has been untouched
 * for at least `minAgeMs`, and say which.
 *
 * Called at the start of a run rather than only at the end of one: the leftover
 * exists precisely because the previous run's cleanup did not get to execute,
 * so a second cleanup path scheduled the same way would not have run either.
 * The next run's startup is the first moment that is guaranteed to happen.
 *
 * Below the age ceiling, the sweep checks liveness before the minimum age:
 * a run marks its own scratch with its pid (`markScratchOwner`), and a directory whose
 * owner appears alive is protected only below `maxAgeMs`. That matters
 * because mtime stops advancing once the copy that filled the tree has
 * finished, so a run that then blocks — a debugger, a suspended process, a
 * laptop that slept — goes on aging while it is very much alive.
 *
 * Age is the fallback, for a directory with no usable marker: leftovers that
 * predate this mechanism, and any run whose marker could not be written. It is
 * also the ceiling — past `maxAgeMs` a living-owner claim is overruled, because
 * a reused pid can keep a dead run's tree protected. This can also remove a
 * genuinely active tree; see MAX_SCRATCH_AGE_MS for the accepted risk.
 *
 * Top level only. A scratch directory is created directly under ROOT, so that
 * is where a stale one is; recursing would mean walking into a tree this
 * function is about to delete, and a `.tmp-script-test-` name deeper in the
 * repository belongs to whoever put it there.
 *
 * Symlinks are never followed, and never removed: `entry.isDirectory()` is
 * false for one, so a link named like a scratch directory is skipped before any
 * of this. That is load-bearing — this function authorises a recursive delete,
 * and following a link would move that delete somewhere nobody asked for — so
 * `tests/scratch-dirs.test.mjs` pins it rather than leaving it to be inferred
 * from `withFileTypes`.
 *
 * Returns the names rather than printing them, so the caller decides whether a
 * sweep is worth a line of output. Silence would be wrong — a run that quietly
 * deleted a directory is its own small mystery — but that is the caller's call
 * to make, not this function's.
 *
 * A directory that cannot be removed is reported, not thrown: a sweep is
 * housekeeping in front of the real work, and failing the whole suite because a
 * stale copy is momentarily locked would replace a false red with another one.
 * The walkers skip it regardless, so the run stays correct either way.
 *
